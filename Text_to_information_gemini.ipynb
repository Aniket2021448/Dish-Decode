      "* Olive oil\n",
      "* Salt\n",
      "* Pepper\n",
      "* English mustard (amount not specified)\n",
      "* 700 grams chestnut mushrooms\n",
      "* 1 clove garlic, chopped\n",

      "4. Cook the mushroom mixture in a hot dry pan until all the water is evaporated. Stir in fresh thyme.\n",
      "5. Let the mushroom mixture cool.\n",
      "6. Wrap the beef fillet with overlapping slices of Parma ham, ensuring it's completely covered.  Season with pepper.\n",
      "7. Spread the cooled mushroom mixture thinly over the ham-wrapped beef, leaving a ½ inch border.\n",
      "8. Carefully wrap the beef with the Parma ham and mushroom mixture, creating a tight cylinder shape.\n",
      "9. Wrap the cylinder tightly in cling film, and chill for 15 minutes.\n",
      "10. Wrap the cling-film-covered beef in puff pastry, sealing the edges tightly.  Wrap again in cling film, chilling for 5 minutes.\n",
      "11. Remove the cling film. Brush the pastry with egg yolk and score the top decoratively. Sprinkle with salt.\n",
      "12. Bake at 200 degrees Celsius for approximately 35 minutes (depending on desired doneness of the beef).\n",
      "13. Let the Wellington rest for at least 10 minutes before slicing and serving.\n",

However, based on the ingredients, a serving of this Beef Wellington will be very high in protein (from the beef), fat (from the beef, ham, and mushrooms), and carbohydrates (from the mushrooms, chestnuts, and pastry).  A single serving (assuming 4-6 servings) could easily contain 800-1200 calories or more, with a high saturated fat content.  The precise nutritional breakdown would depend heavily on the exact amount of beef and pastry used.\n",

      "\n",
      "* Horse radish can be used as an alternative to English mustard.\n",
      "* A traditional Beef Wellington uses a chive and spring onion pancake instead of Parma ham, resulting in a heavier dish.\n",

      "* **People with health concerns:**  Due to its high calorie, saturated fat, and potentially high sodium content, individuals managing weight, cholesterol, or blood pressure should avoid or limit their consumption.  Those with gout should also be cautious due to the purine content in the mushrooms and meat.\n",
